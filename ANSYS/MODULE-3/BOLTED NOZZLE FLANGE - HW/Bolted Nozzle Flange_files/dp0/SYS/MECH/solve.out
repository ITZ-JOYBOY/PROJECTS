 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.234   TIME= 23:38:03
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.234   TIME= 23:38:03
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 330).                     

     138 CONTACT ELEMENTS &     135 TARGET ELEMENTS ARE UNSELECTED FOR PREPARATION OF          SPLITTING.
       5 CONTACT PAIRS ARE UNSELECTED. 

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       2.234   TIME= 23:38:03
 The maximum number of contact elements in any single contact pair is    
 49, which is smaller than the optimal domain size of 298 elements for   
 the given number of CPU domains (4).  Therefore, no contact pairs are   
 being split by the CNCH,DMP logic.                                      

 BECAUSE SPLIT WAS NOT DONE FOR CONNECT REGION(S), UNSELECTED ELEMENTS ARE REVERTED (SELECTED).

 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 9 and contact element type 9 has been set up.  The

 the same behavior.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.828   TIME= 23:38:02
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.891   TIME= 23:38:02
 Material number 19 (used by element 10871) should normally have at      
 least one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of      
 energy by material may not be available.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.234   TIME= 23:38:03
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.234   TIME= 23:38:03
 Boundary conditions, coupling, and/or constraint equations have been    
 applied on certain contact nodes (for example 330).

 Table _FIX is an MAPDL reserved table name.  It is used to constrain    
 structural degrees of freedom to their current displaced status.  This  
 table should not be used for other purposes.
